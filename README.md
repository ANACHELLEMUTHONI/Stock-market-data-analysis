# Stock-market-data-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the stock market performance of three major companies: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG). The analysis involves loading stock market data from CSV files into pandas DataFrames, performing data cleaning and manipulation, and visualizing the data to gain insights.

Project Overview:
1. Data Loading: CSV data for AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG stocks is loaded into separate pandas DataFrames.
2. Data Preparation: The 'Adj Close' column is selected as the main data of interest, and Dates are set as the index for each DataFrame.
3. Combining Data: All three stock DataFrames are combined into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.
4. Handling Missing Values: Null values are identified and dropped from the combined DataFrame to ensure data integrity.
5. Data Visualization: A graph depicting the stock prices of Google (GOOG) is plotted, including a legend for clarity.
